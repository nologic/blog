I am a Director of Research and Data at SYNACK Inc, which means that my role includes a wide range of topics from security research to data science and everything in between. I am passionate about finding vulnerabilities, improving security, creating quality systems and, most of all, discovery. I enjoy giving presentations and teaching others. 

My broad experience covers low-level assembly reverse engineering, exploitation, big data cloud platform development and high-order analytics. I can work comfortably at just about any technical level. In addition to my technical experiences, I have also worked in international business liaison and team leadership roles. 

This blog meant to document various things that I find useful and/or intersting. Much of it is aimed at educating a novice researcher because if information is not accessible then why write at all. If something strikes your fancy, you would like to discuss a topic or just feel like you need some advice, please feel free to reach out.
